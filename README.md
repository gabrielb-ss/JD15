# ❓ How to play
The game has the same principles and rules as the traditional 15 puzzle game, but you have a distinct time and move limit for each level.

# 🎮 Releases

# Aditional information
This game was my first game ever made back in early 2020. I know there are many many flaws, unfortunately I don't have the time to fix them. Please don't be harsh.

This game has no virus (I'm not that good lol) but if you don't believe me, you can check the code.

The game save files are at C:\Users\your_user_here\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\JD15 on Windows.
As for Android save files: only God can tell/jk they are in the root.
